Pixelflut Tools

Pixelfluter is a basic client for the program Pixelflut, which is popular in the CCC environment. 

The purpose of this client is not the usually required competitive dominating of the screen. Pixelfluter is only meant as an idea generator for my 
youth group, and should convey the basic functionality and the (limited) possibilities of Pixelflut. However, if you are a newcomer looking for a 
simple introduction to Pixelflut, this client with its small tools can certainly be a helpful starting point, which can encourage more intensive discussion of the topic.
